## Obro≈Ñcy Galaktyki - Galaxy Defenders

This is a simple game inspired on Space Invanders.\
It's coded by me in curses. I've focused purely on simplicity, and after all added some colrs into game.\
Thanks for courtesy of windows-curses module, it runs smoothly on windows cmd line and PowerShell.\
Unfortunatelly not tested on Linux native systems.\
On WSL it runs rather purly.

# Controls
left - spaceship goes left by one char;\
right - your spacecraft moves right by one char;\
spacebar - ship shoots a missle;
